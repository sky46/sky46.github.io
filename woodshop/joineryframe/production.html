                I received my 5 pieces of wood: 2 long pieces and 3 short ones. They were already cut out in the starting dimensions for us.
                The long ones were 16” x 2” x 1”, and the short pieces were 8” x 2” x 1”. The thickness was a little off; 
                I think they were actually more like 15/16” thick. 
              </p>
              <p>
                First, we decided where each piece would go. Though they were all the same dimensions, we could strategically pick 
                and choose where we wanted each piece to go so that when we made the cuts for the joints, we would cut out the 
                imperfections and they wouldn’t be in the final product. For the most part, my wood was fine, but I did 
                purposefully place a couple pieces such that a slight unevenness would be cut out; for example, I placed 
                one of the short pieces in a way that a little imperfection on the end would be cut out in the mitre joint. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, following the SketchUp, we drew on the markings and guides that we’d use when cutting, indicating where 
                to cut and what areas would be cut out. Mr. Doherty explained how and where we needed to mark. We used measuring
                tapes and squares (a tool for drawing lines perfectly parallel/perpendicular to the wood). It was harder than I 
                expected to be exactly precise with the drawing. We also labelled the joints with the corresponding numbers (1-6)
                on each piece. Then, we started the cutting process.

                This was probably the simplest joint of all. I set up the mitre saw to cut a 45° angle and lowered the blade 
                to line it up with our marking, holding the wood firmly against the wall with my left hand at a safe distance. 
                Then, I held the safety button and trigger which turned the saw on, and lowered it straight down through the wood.
                At the bottom, I released the trigger and waited for the saw to stop before pulling it back up. I repeated this
                process but with the opposite 45° angle for the other piece of the mitre joint. 
              </p>

                This was also a pretty simple joint. Using the same process as the mitre joint, I used the mitre saw to cut 
                off 2 inches of the long piece, this time at a 90° angle instead. 
              </p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-production rounded mb-3" src="https://i3.lensdump.com/i/gDhm8M.jpg" alt="butt joint">
              <p>
                I also used the drill press to drill a small hole in the side of the small piece, which would later be used
                for a screw. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Then, at the very end once everything was sanded, I glued and used a screw to secure the butt joint in place.
                I first drilled a little hole for the screw through the short piece, where the previously made hole was. I then 
                spread some carpenting glue using my finger on the end of the long piece where it would meet the short one,
                then put them together tightly in a vise. My friend Muhammad helped me to make sure they were straight and flush
                together. After, I used an electric screwdriver to put a screw through the small hole and into the longer piece.
                I then put some glue in the hole and filled it in with wooden plug. Once the glue was dried, I moved it in the 
                vise and cut off the excess plug using a hand saw. Finally, I sanded the whole area including the plug until it was
                smooth. The two pieces of the butt joint were now firmly joined together.

              3 & 4: Dovetail joints
            </button>

                The dovetail was one of, if not the, most complex joints to create. First, we created the ‘inside’ parts of 
                the joints (the parts on the small piece in the middle that would fit into the part we’d cut out in the 
                long pieces). We did this in two steps: we cut out the diagonal cuts using the band saw and a jig that lined 
                up the angle and distance for us (see image) so we simply had to push it straight through the saw, and then 
                we cut out the horizontal parts which were just at a 90° angle (once again using the band saw). For that 
                second step, we had to use a push stick to push the dovetail in and push the piece that was cut off out of 
                the way, for safety purposes and so that the piece didn’t get jammed and possibly break the saw. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Afterwards, I created the ‘outside’ parts of the joints, where the inside parts would sit. I traced the inside 
                parts onto the long pieces of wood, making sure to line them up properly, put the wood tightly inside a vise, 
                and then began cutting with a hand saw. I first made two cuts halfway through the thickness of the wood on the 
                lines where I traced, which marked the sides of the joint. Because of the nature of the joint, we had to use a 
                process where we cut out numerous parallel cuts between the two initial cuts, creating little ‘slices’ that we 
                would later pry out with a chisel to create the actual shape (see images). I did my best to keep the cuts on 
                the lines, straight down, and exactly to the halfway line. Then, using a chisel, I pried out the ‘slices’ and 
                chiseled out the remainder of the joint. During this process, I kept the chisel pretty much flat, I kept two 
                hands on it, and I only went halfway through before going from the other direction so as to not tear off any 
                of the wood on the other side. I made the joint as flat as I could so that the dovetail would fit snugly and 
                precisely inside.

                Finally, I traced the thickness that I needed to cut out from the inside dovetail so that it’d fit properly 
                in the outside part. I adjusted the table saw to the correct height and then used it to cut out the bottom 
                half of the dovetail bit by bit. It was adjusted so that at the last cut, I could just align it and then hold 
                it tightly while pushing it through the saw so that it would be at exactly the 2 inches that I needed to cut 
                off. Once this was done, I chiseled the outer part a little bit more so that it would fit correctly, finishing 
                the dovetail.

                This was also a fairly complex joint. Because of the tech room we were in, it wasn’t wasn’t ideal to make 
                the mortise. First, I made the approximate shape of the mortise using the drill press. It unfortunately 
                moved a little bit as I wasn’t holding the wood tight enough, so it didn’t go all the way down at one end, 
                but I could just chisel that away after. I then put the wood tightly in a vise and then used a sharp chisel 
                and a rubber mallet to chisel out the remainder of the shape as well as what I missed when I was using the 
                drill press. I had to change to a different vise because the one I was originally using wasn’t tight enough, 
                and the wood just moved when I used the mallet and chisel. After a lot of work, I chiseled out the final 
                shape of the mortise, making the corners sharp and the bottom flat.

              <p>
                Next, I made the tenon. I measured the height of the mortise, then adjusted the table saw using the measurement. 
                Using the same process as the dovetail, I cut out the bottom and top of the tenon. Then, I did the same thing but
                with the width of the mortise and the sides of the tenon. I also measured the depth of the mortise using a ruler and
                drew a corresponding line on the tenon.

              <p>
                Finally, I cut off the marked part on the end using the mitre saw. It didn't quite fit inside the mortise,
                so I filed down some of the sides and the end of the tenon until it fit nicely.

                I created the half lap using the same process as the last step of the dovetail joint and the tenon. The height of the table saw was set to 
                ½” (half the thickness of the wood) and I cut the piece of wood bit by bit until I reached the 2 inches (again, it was 
                adjusted so that I could line it up against the wall and have it exactly at the 2 inches). This process wasn’t really 
                difficult; I just had to hold the wood tightly. It was the same for both pieces of the half lap. After cutting, I used a 
                chisel to flatten out the cut a little bit, making sure not to change the depth or shape.

                  To finish the project, I first used the orbital sander to sand off the pencil and rougher parts. Then, I used a block of wood and some sandpaper
                  to sand it by hand until it was smooth, starting with 120 grit and then moving to 180.

                  I'm pretty happy with the finished
                  project. Though there are some minor errors, overall, it turned out quite well. I definitely learned a lot about the various
                  types of wood joinery and it was a fun project to make. It used some different techniques and tools from the barbecue scraper,
                  and it was more difficult (though I had some more experience this time).
