      <h3>Step 2: Design</h3>
      <p>
        Once again, we created our designs in <a href="https://edu.sketchup.com">SketchUp for Education</a>. The designing in SketchUp was
        definitely more complicated this time, as we had many different parts in our planter boxes and because we each came up with our own designs.
        Since pieces such as the side boards and the trim repeated themselves, so it was convenient to copy and paste them instead of having to
        recreate them over and over again. This also facilitated making certain changes to the project like adding an extra board or piece of trim
        here and there, but it was tricky to make larger changes due to the intricacy; I often had to change and move many different pieces, and spent 
        a lot of time trying to get a design that I was satisfied with it. Again, it wasn't required to sketch the design on paper.
        <br><br>
        My design was a pretty common style for planter boxes: I had vertical boards glued together for the sides; some more boards glued together
        on the bottom; corner, side, and top trim; and corner trim that extended past the bottom which served as the legs. It wasn't very long, tall,
        or wide in either direction, but it was a rectangular shape.

      <p>
        During the design of this project, we were introduced to creating cut lists and calculating board feet. This really helped
        with knowing exactly how many of what pieces we needed when building the planters, as well as with knowing how much
        wood we needed. Board footage  is calculated using the formula \(\frac{T * W * L} {144} \), where \(T\), \(W\), and \(H\) are
        the nominal thickness in inches, nominal width in inches, and actual length in feet respectively. We were aiming for 6-8 board feet,
        and I made some adjustments in order to reach that (intially my design was a couple of board feet too small). Below is the spreadsheet 
        that I used for creating the cut list and calculating the board feet (I just put in the dimensions and it automatically did the
        calculations for the board feet and cubic inches). I filled it in by measuring the pieces in my SketchUp using the measuring tape
        tool.
