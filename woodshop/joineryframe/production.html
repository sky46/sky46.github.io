                    I received my 5 pieces of wood: 2 long pieces and 3 short ones. They were already cut out in the starting dimensions for us.
                    The long ones were 16” x 2” x 1”, and the short pieces were 8” x 2” x 1”. The thickness was a little off; 
                    I think they were actually more like 15/16” thick. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, we decided where each piece would go. Though they were all the same dimensions, we could strategically pick 
                    and choose where we wanted each piece to go so that when we made the cuts for the joints, we would cut out the 
                    imperfections and they wouldn’t be in the final product. For the most part, my wood was fine, but I did 
                    purposefully place a couple pieces such that a slight unevenness would be cut out; for example, I placed 
                    one of the short pieces in a way that a little imperfection on the end would be cut out in the mitre joint. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, following the SketchUp, we drew on the markings and guides that we’d use when cutting, indicating where 
                    to cut and what areas would be cut out. Mr. Doherty explained how and where we needed to mark. We used measuring
                    tapes and squares (a tool for drawing lines perfectly parallel/perpendicular to the wood). It was harder than I 
                    expected to be exactly precise with the drawing. We also labelled the joints with the corresponding numbers (1-6)
                    on each piece. Then, we started the cutting process.

                    This was probably the simplest joint of all. I set up the mitre saw to cut a 45degree angle and lowered the blade 
                    to line it up with our marking, holding the wood firmly against the wall with my left hand at a safe distance. 
                    Then, I held the safety button and trigger which turned the saw on, and lowered it straight down through the wood.
                    At the bottom, I released the trigger and waited for the saw to stop before pulling it back up. I repeated this
                    process but with the opposite 45 degree angle for the other piece of the mitre joint.

                    This was also a pretty simple joint. Using the same process as the mitre joint, I used the mitre saw to cut 
                    off 2 inches of the long piece, this time at a 90degree angle instead.

                    The dovetail was one of, if not the, most complex joints to create. First, we created the ‘inside’ parts of 
                    the joints (the parts on the small piece in the middle that would fit into the part we’d cut out in the 
                    long pieces). We did this in two steps: we cut out the diagonal cuts using the band saw and a jig that lined 
                    up the angle and distance for us (see image) so we simply had to push it straight through the saw, and then 
                    we cut out the horizontal parts which were just at a 90degree angle (once again using the band saw). For that 
                    second step, we had to use a push stick to push the dovetail in and push the piece that was cut off out of 
                    the way, for safety purposes and so that the piece didn’t get jammed and possibly break the saw.

                    Afterwards, I created the ‘outside’ parts of the joints, where the inside parts would sit. I traced the inside 
                    parts onto the long pieces of wood, making sure to line them up properly, put the wood tightly inside a vise, 
                    and then began cutting with a hand saw. I first made two cuts halfway through the thickness of the wood on the 
                    lines where I traced, which marked the sides of the joint. Because of the nature of the joint, we had to use a 
                    process where we cut out numerous parallel cuts between the two initial cuts, creating little ‘slices’ that we 
                    would later pry out with a chisel to create the actual shape (see images). I did my best to keep the cuts on 
                    the lines, straight down, and exactly to the halfway line. Then, using a chisel, I pried out the ‘slices’ and 
                    chiseled out the remainder of the joint. During this process, I kept the chisel pretty much flat, I kept two 
                    hands on it, and I only went halfway through before going from the other direction so as to not tear off any 
                    of the wood on the other side. I made the joint as flat as I could so that the dovetail would fit snugly and 
                    precisely inside.

                    Finally, I traced the thickness that I needed to cut out from the inside dovetail so that it’d fit properly 
                    in the outside part. I adjusted the table saw to the correct height and then used it to cut out the bottom 
                    half of the dovetail bit by bit. It was adjusted so that at the last cut, I could just align it and then hold 
                    it tightly while pushing it through the saw so that it would be at exactly the 2 inches that I needed to cut 
                    off. Once this was done, I chiseled the outer part a little bit more so that it would fit correctly, finishing 
                    the dovetail.

                    This was also a fairly complex joint. Because of the tech room we were in, it wasn’t wasn’t ideal to make 
                    the mortise. First, I made the approximate shape of the mortise using the drill press. It unfortunately 
                    moved a little bit as I wasn’t holding the wood tight enough, so it didn’t go all the way down at one end, 
                    but I could just chisel that away after. I then put the wood tightly in a vise and then used a sharp chisel 
                    and a rubber mallet to chisel out the remainder of the shape as well as what I missed when I was using the 
                    drill press. I had to change to a different vise because the one I was originally using wasn’t tight enough, 
                    and the wood just moved when I used the mallet and chisel. After a lot of work, I chiseled out the final 
                    shape of the mortise, making the corners sharp and the bottom flat.

                    I created the half lap using the same process as the last step of the dovetail joint. The height of the table saw was set to 
                    ½” (half the thickness of the wood) and I cut the piece of wood bit by bit until I reached the 2 inches (again, it was 
                    adjusted so that I could line it up against the wall and have it exactly at the 2 inches). This process wasn’t really 
                    difficult; I just had to hold the wood tightly. It was the same for both pieces of the half lap. After cutting, I used a 
                    chisel to flatten out the cut a little bit, making sure not to change the depth or shape.
