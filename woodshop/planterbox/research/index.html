      <h3>Step 1: Research</h3>
      <p>
        Like with the BBQ scraper, I started by looking at various different designs for planter boxes online. I saved the images
        that interested me, and then looked at the specific I liked aspects for each one. There were a variety of designs that I
        found. Most were either rectangular prisms or cubes, which is the shape I wanted to do. Some were taller and some were longer.
        Most of them had the same general idea, with attached vertical or horizontal boards for the side walls, and at least some trim 
        on the top, sides, and corners. Most also had legs from the corner trim extending down past the bottom. The width and thickness
        of the trim varied between the designs. Some also had long pieces of wood fully inside the corners rather than just trim 
        covering the outside. Below are 9 different designs that I saved and took inspiration from.
