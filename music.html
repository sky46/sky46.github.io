  <h1>I love music!</h1>
  <h2>I play the guitar and (try to) sing a bit too. I also listen to music a lot. I play in the Nepean All-City Lab Band as well as
    in the Merivale High School Jazz Band.

  My favourite song is No Surprises, off OK Computer, my favourite album, by Radiohead, my favourite band.
  I mostly listen to pop and some rock; some other artists I like are John Mayer, Ed Sheeran, The Beatles, Queen, 
  Taylor Swift, Nothing But Thieves, Blur, Scott Helman, Pat Metheny, John Scofield, Julian Lage, and Wes Montgomery.

  My guitar teacher is a local musician named Lucas Haneman. He plays guitar and sings in a blues band called The
  Lucas Haneman Express. Though I don't listen to a lot of blues, I enjoy their songs and especially Lucas's guitar
  solos! Give them a listen on Spotify, SoundCloud, or YouTube!

  I have been taking guitar lessons with him since spring of 2019, and I have really learned a lot.
  Playing the guitar has truly become one of my passions.

<p>I also played piano for quite a few years before I started guitar.</p>
