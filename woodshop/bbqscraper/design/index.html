      <h3>Step 2: Design</h3>
      <p>
        I used characteristics and parts that I liked from a few different scrapers that I researched in my final design.
        To create it, I used <a href="https://edu.sketchup.com/app">Sketchup for Education</a>, a free online tool. It's 
        very useful for this kind of thing, and it was pretty easy to learn the basics. Due to the specific curves and 
        edges, I had to use many guide lines. I also drew a top-down view with dimensions on paper, to scale. (Both below in image carousel)
        <br><br>
        My design was pretty 'normal' and similar to most barbecue scrapers. It included a long but shallow inside curve on 
        the neck, mainly because I liked the way it looked, but I figured it'd also be comfortable. There are a few outside
        curves on the handle at the top, as I wanted a pretty rounded shape for both comfort and looks. I made transition from the
        from the neck to the blade pretty gradual and curved, as I preferred this look from my research. There is also a hole 
        in the handle for a string or something else to attach. The blade starts going in around halfway past the start of the 
        wide blade part, and it goes in only from one side rather than having both sides converge in the middle. I chose this
        both because it looks good and I felt a slightly bulkier blade would be beneficial. I considered adding some sort of
        design on the handle (like the loon example from my research) or adding grooves on the handle for your fingers, but 
        I ultimately decided against both; the former due to functionality and comfort, and the second mostly because of time 
        and work restrictions at the time.
