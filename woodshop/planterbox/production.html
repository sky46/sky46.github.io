                I began by picking out my pieces. I tried my best to pick flat, straight ones as many were warped or had imperfections.
                I started with the pieces for the main sides and the bottom. There is a large pile in the tech room of pieces to
                choose from, but I needed pieces that were 1 inch thick, while the pieces in the tech room were only ¾ of an inch
                thick. Mr. Doherty brought pieces from another room, which were all pretty flat and long, and thick enough for my box.
              </p>
              <p>
                This time, I didn't really need to do any drawing or marking on the pieces because many had the same dimensions and the
                table and mitre saws could cut them precisely and uniformly without the help of drawings/measurements on the wood. I
                basically just measured the large pieces and figured out how many of what kind of piece I would be able to cut from it
                based off of the dimensions.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this time, I also picked out some of the pieces for my trim, but I later realized that it was a different kind of
                wood, so I ended up having to redo those pieces from another piece of wood that was the same type as the rest of my box.

                I first used the table saw to cut all the long pieces to the correct width, then used the mitre saw to cut the resulting boards
                to the correct lengths. Since many of the pieces were the same, I first measured and cut one to the correct length, and then used
                that initial one to line up and cut the rest of the pieces to the exact same length. I left a little bit of excess (e.g. if I needed a 12
                inch long piece, I'd cut it to 12.25 inches) on the length of the pieces to leave some room for inevitable error during the gluing process,
                after which I could still cut the edge flat while still keeping the correct length. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Mr. Doherty did the cutting with the table saw. He adjusted the height of the table saw and the distance of the fence to what I needed, then
                pushed it through with his hands and then a wooden push stick, keeping a straight edge flat with the fence. For the mitre saw, I measured and
                marked using a pencil the desired length (as I said, leaving some excess), then pushed the wood flat against the guide, lined up the saw blade
                (making sure to cut on the outside of the line to account for the thickness of the blade), held it in place, and cut the initial piece. I then
                used this initial piece to line up and cut all the pieces that were the same length, and then repeated this process for subsequent pieces.

                After that, I scored each side that would be glued using a chisel—that is, I made little X’s on the wood using
                the sharp point of the chisel. I believe the purpose of this was to make the glue be absorbed and adhere to the
                wood better and more easily. I tried my best not to go all the way to the edges to avoid damaging the sides of
                the wood.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then came the gluing itself. I placed the wood into 2 parallel loosened clamps. One by one, I took a piece,
                applied some glue along the side to be glued using the bottle, spread it evenly using a short, thin piece of
                used excess wood, repeated for the other side if necessary, and replaced it into the clamps. Once all the pieces
                had glue, I tightened the clamps at the same time so that it would be even. I made sure to keep the pieces flat
                and properly aligned, as well as putting the clamps on the very edges of the wood, to prevent unevenness and
                splitting. I wiped the extra glue being squeezed out on the top and bottom with a paper towel, and then put
                'one more clamp in the middle and a weight or two on top of the wood to keep it flat. I repeated this process,
                doing one face per day (we didn’t have that many clamps). I think Mr. Doherty removed the wood from the clamps
                later in the day after the class. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Once each face was finished gluing, I scraped off any glue I could using an upside-down chisel (upside-down to
                avoid damaging the wood), then cut the sides flat using the table saw. I first cut off a tiny bit on one side to
                get a straight edge, then lined it up using the straight edge and cut the other side to the desired width. The
                excess length I had left on the pieces left me with just enough to keep the correct dimensions. Between classes,
                Mr. Doherty put the faces through the thickness planer in the other room to smooth out the pieces and get them all
                the same thickness. The last 2 images in the carousel below especially show the difference before and after being
                thickness planed.

              <p>
                Now that I had all the main pieces, I was ready to assemble my planter box. For this process, I used a combination
                of nails and glue.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, there was one final adjustment to be made to the sides: due to having been thickness planed, the bottom face
                was slightly too wide in one direction. To fix this, I simply measured the correct dimension (sum of side board
                thickness + side board thickness + side board length) and cut the bottom board to this dimension using the table
                saw.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now for the actual assembly itself. I started by attaching one side to the bottom face, then went around and attached
                the other faces. For each face, I spread glue on the surface(s) that would be attached using a short, thin piece
                of wood or my finger (no need to score with a chisel), held the two pieces firmly in place, lined up one end so that
                it was flush and straight, and then used the pressure nailer to put a nail in that end. Then, I adjusted the other
                end to also be straight and smooth, and nailed that too. Some of the longer sides required a nail in the middle too.
                I wiped off any excess glue and proceeded to attaching the next side, repeating the process for the rest of the sides.
                Mr. Doherty used the pressure nailer for the first couple to show me how, and I did the rest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once all the sides were attached and the glue had dried (I attached all the faces in one class and it dried overnight),
                I used a power sander to smooth out any imperfections created when gluing and nailing, mainly on the top and bottom. 
                It still wasn't perfect (I slightly over-sanded some parts) but I did a pretty good job and it was good enough. 
                These parts would be covered by trim anyways in the final product.

                The final addition to my planter box was trim to cover up some of the edges, cracks, and imperfections from the 
                assembly process, and also just for decoration. The corner trim doubly serves as legs, extending past the bottom
                of the box. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I began by cutting all the trim. I had previously cut some trim with the main pieces, but could not use it for 2
                reasons: First, it was a visibly different type of wood; and secondly, the dimensions of the actual box were not
                the exact same as those of the intial design. I cut and attached the corner trim, then the side trim, then the
                top trim.   
              </p>
              <p>
                The corner trim consisted of 8 total pieces, all of the same length and distance, with 4 of them at one width and 4 at another.
                One of each width was used in each corner so that with the thickness of the wood, the widths are effectively equal.
                I cut a few long pieces of wood into the correct thickness and widths using the table saw, then cut and measured one 
                piece to the correct length using the mitre saw. I proceeded to use this piece to line up, measure, and cut the rest
                of the pieces to the correct length. Similarly to when assembling the main box, I used glue and the pressure nailer
                to put these pieces onto the box.

                I repeated pretty much the same process with the side trim along the top and bottom edges, though for these I had to
                take a new length measurement from distance between the corner trims, as the dimensions had changed a bit since my
                inital design and calculations. I did not need glue for these smaller pieces of trim. While nailing this trim, I
                accidently used nails that were too long, and 3 or 4 went through the other end before I realized. I placed the metal
                end of a square screwdriver on the protruding nail and used a hammer to push it back in a little bit; with some help
                from Mr. Doherty, the too-long nails were no longer visible and there was only a small depression that you could feel.

              <p>
                Finally, I measured the correct length across the top, cut a piece at a 45 degree angle on both ends, attached it with
                glue and nails, and repeated this process for all 4 pieces of top trim. It was a bit tricky, but I managed to make the
                top trim fit nicely, being even, straight, and flat with the rest of the wood.

              <p>
                I also used a paste-like mixture of sawdust from sanding and glue to fill in the holes created by the nails. I simply
                used my finger to put some in side and over the small apertures. The small bit of excess wasn't a problem as it would
                be sanded down later.

                Finally, I had to sand and stain. Sanding serves the purpose of making it smoother, and staining just makes it look
                nicer, changing the colour and highlighting the natural texture of the wood. There's also finish, which actually
                protects the wood, but I don't think we used it for this project.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started by using the power sander again. I tried my best to smooth out the unevenness on the various faces of
                the box. It mainly helped with the top and corner trim. I also tried to flatten as many of the dried-up bits of
                sawdust-glue-paste used to fill in the nail holes as I could, though some were hard to reach with the power sander
                and had to be sanded down by hand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, I moved on to hand-sanding. By now a familiar task from the other projects, I took a piece of sandpaper and
                wrapped it around a small block of wood. I used it to sand all the outside surfaces of the box (WITH the grain!)
                and then moved on to a higher grit, moving from 120 grit, to 180, and finally to 240. When it was done, the box was
                nice and smooth all around and I brushed as much sawdust as I could off and out of the box using a brush.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last thing to do was stain. I went into the little room and closed the door to avoid sawdust getting in, dipped
                the wide paint brush into the stain (I chose a dark stain), and spread it over all the surfaces of the box. I let it
                dry overnight and then finished the bottom the next day. I did my best to get a nice even coat everywhere. Once everything
                was done, I left it at school to dry in the room over the weekend (it was a Friday) and brought it home the following week.
              </p>
              <p>
                And with that, my planter box was completed! I gave it to my sister for her birthday, only  a week or two after 
                I completed the box. I'm quite satisfied with the result! Though the joinery and shapes might not be as complex
                as those of the previous projects, I think that this was the most functional, complicated, and impressive project
                overall thus far. I learned to use new techniques and tools such as gluing and nailing, and it was a lot of fun!
