          <h3>Step 3: Production</h3>

          <p>
            I started with a piece of wood that was 18" x 5.5" and drew my design on it, being careful to use precise measurements, a ruler,
            a square (tool for drawing lines perpendicular to the wood), and curve tools. 
          </p>
          <img class="img-fluid img-production rounded mb-5" src="https://i1.lensdump.com/i/gdQYpr.jpg" alt="wood with design drawn on">
          
          <p>
            Next, I used the band saw to first make relief cuts (shorter, smaller cuts to make it easier to make larger, sharper cuts later),
            and then cut out the general shape of barbecue scraper. I stayed on the waste side of the line (cutting slightly outside the line)
            so as to not cut too much, and so I could sand it more easily later.
          </p>
          <img class="img-fluid img-production rounded mb-5" src="https://i1.lensdump.com/i/gdQPYD.jpg" alt="scraper with rough cuts">
          
          <p>
            After that, I used the disk sander to precisely sand down the outside curves, and the spindle sander for the inside and hard-to-reach 
            curves. Due to the size of the spindle sander, I had to slightly deviate from my design for a few curves. By then, my barbecue scraper
            was really taking shape! I also made the hole in the handle (slightly larger than my original design after I realized it would've been
            too small) with the drill press. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I then used a small cut of wood and some sandpaper to smooth out the sides and edges by hand, going from coarse to increasingly fine sandpaper.
            One side of the wood was very rough and took quite a bit of sanding; I put on some music and got right to it. The sanding helped finish
            up the shape of my scraper, and made it much more comfortable to hold due to the rounding of previously sharp edges. It also removed the 
            pencil lines and a few small scratches on the surface of the scraper. During this step, the blade of the scraper was also formed using the 
            disk sander (I couldn't do it myself unfortunately).
          </p>

          <p>Finally, I finished the sanding using fine sandpaper. Throughout the hand-sanding, I tried to round out the handle and neck
            quite a bit for increased comfort when using it. I also spent a lot of time to make sure it was very smooth everywhere, which
            I was pretty successful in doing. To sand the hole, I rolled up a piece of sandpaper and went up and down inside. After all the sanding
            was done, I applied a bit of mineral oil across all the surfaces of the scraper to help the preservation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, I'm very happy with how it turned out. The surface is very smooth, the shape is convenient and comfortable to use, and 
            I quite like the way it looks. There are some slight asymmetries and scratches, but nothing really noticeable without close inspection,
            and definitely nothing that brings down the overall barbecue scraper significantly. I would've also liked the neck to have been a little
            rounder. This was a fun first project, and I definitely learned a lot about the design and production of something like this. I look forward
            to future projects in this class!
          </p>
