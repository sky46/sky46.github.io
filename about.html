      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        I'm a student in Grade 9 at Merivale High School. Science is my favourite subject. I play the guitar and love
        listening to music. I also enjoy playing hockey, tennis and ultimate frisbee. I've lived in Riverside South for most
        of my life. Through kindergarten, elementary, and middle school, I went to Steve Maclean Public School (that's 10 years!).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In my free time, I like playing video games. My favourites are Minecraft (Java Edition), The Legend of Zelda: Breath 
        of the Wild, and Mario Kart Wii. Lately, I've also been playing some Valorant, League of Legends, Hollow Knight, and 
        Stardew Valley. I play on the Nintendo Switch and on my PC (i.e. old slow laptop).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I love music! I've been learning to play guitar for around 2 years now with a local teacher named Lucas Haneman. He 
        has a Blues band called the Lucas Haneman Express - Check them out <a href="http://www.lhexpress.ca/">here</a>! Their
        music is on YouTube and Spotify. Honestly, I have to admit that I haven't listened to that much music. Mostly just specific
        songs or bands that I like or hear on the radio (though these days I mostly listen to Spotify). My favourite band is Radiohead,
        and my favourite song is No Surprises (by Radiohead). I also listen to John Mayer, The Beatles, Ed Sheeran, and quite a few
        others.
      </p>

        I am an avid learner; I've always enjoyed school. My favourite subjects are science and math. I'm very curious
        about how our world works. Understanding mysterious forces like gravity and light is very interesting to me.
        Recently, I applied for the IB (International Baccalaureate) programme at my local high school. IB is a secondary
        school diploma programme dedicated to providing a rich, rigorous education that encourages leadership,
        independence, and creativity. I really hope to get in, as I think it'll help me become a better learner and
        I'll be able to meet others who share my passion and interest for learning.
      </p>!-->

      <p>
        I love using technology. Playing video games and programming are some of my favourite hobbies. I started
        taking CS50x in late 2020, and it was a really great experience. I had a bit of prior experience from learning
        Python from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, but CS50 still taught me a lot. In the CS50 community, I've
        met many passionate, skilled programmers. Now, I'm taking CS50's Web Programming Course.
        I love programming because it's amazing seeing code that you wrote put into action. Technology is almost magical 
        sometimes!

      <h3>About The Skloud</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        I originally made this site for Homepage, a assignment in week 8 of CS50x. However, I spent way too much time trying to perfect tiny
        details like spacing and Bootstrap, so it took a lot longer than a week. It's now become my personal website (I know it's
        pretty sparse right now, but I'll add more eventually)!
      </p>

      <p>
        "The Skloud" is a (terrible) portmanteau of Skyler, my name, and the Cloud.
