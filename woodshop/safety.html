            <li>The SHORTEST board to be planed is 305 mm(12 inches).</li>
            <li>Set the 'depth of cut' on the Planer by the wood touching the feed rolls. Lower the table until the wood passes through the planer, thenraise the table one turn at a time until the wood no longer passes through.</li>
            <li>Inspect the wood to be planed. Make sure it has NO large cracks, loose knots, nails, glue,sand, paint, or any other material that could damage the cutting blades.</li>
            <li>When planing several boards, plane ALL boards at each thickness setting.</li>
            <li>JOINTED surface of a board always goes DOWN when planing.</li>
            <li>The wood is always planed with the grain, NEVER across the grain.</li>
            <li>Never look into the Planer while the machine is running</li>
            <li>If the wood jams or fails to feed into the Planer, shut the machine off and call the instructor.</li>
            <li>NEVER place your hands near the feed rolls or inside the Planer as it is very dangerous.</li>
            <li>'Walk' boards hand over hand instead of sliding them through your hands to prevent slivers.</li>
            <li>Use a backing board when a piece of wood is ¼ of an inch or under in thickness.</li>

            <li>The edge of the material touching the rip fence must be straight and smooth. (Face edge).</li>
            <li>Always place the part of the material to be kept, BETWEEN the fence and the blade.</li>
