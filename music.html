  <h1>I love music!</h1>
  <h2>I play the guitar and (try to) sing a bit too. I also listen to music a lot.</h2>
  <p>I am the guitarist in the Nepean All-City Lab Band as well as in the Merivale High School Jazz Band.</h2>

  My favourite song is No Surprises, off OK Computer, my favourite album, by Radiohead, my favourite band.
  I mostly listen to pop and some rock. Some other artists I like are John Mayer, Ed Sheeran, The Beatles, Queen, 
  Taylor Swift, Nothing But Thieves, Blur, Scott Helman, Weezer, John Scofield, Julian Lage, Pat Metheny, and Wes Montgomery.

  I started taking guitar lessons in spring of 2019 with a local musician named Lucas Haneman. He plays guitar and
  sings in a blues band called The Lucas Haneman Express. Give them a listen on Spotify, SoundCloud, or YouTube!

  I also played piano for some years before I started guitar. Though I wasn't very good, it definitely helped me improve my
  ear and music theory knowledge.
