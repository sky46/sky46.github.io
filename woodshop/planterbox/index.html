        Our third project was a wooden planter box. It's a wooden container that's used for displaying and growing flowers and other plants. They can be placed
        inside or outside and can take many different shapes. Unlike the joinery frame, this project was more useful (at least for me); my mom really
        likes gardening and has many plants indoors and outdoors around the house, so she really liked it.
        <br><br>
        We definitely had more freedom with this project than with the previous two. Similarly to the barbecue scraper, we researched existing designs online,
        and then using that information, created our own. The planter boxes, though, were more complex than the barbecue scrapers and the joinery frame, so we had more choices
        about things like the shape (there were rectangles, squares, hexagons, and more), the size/dimensions, and various other details such as trim, joinery,
        and legs. There were many different parts and elements during the design and creation of these boxes. Because of this, we were also introduced to making
        a cut list and calculating board feet in order to know how much and what kind of wood we need for a project.
