  My favourite song is Jigsaw Falling Into Place, from In Rainbows, my favourite album, by Radiohead, my favourite band.
  I mostly listen to rock, pop, and jazz. Some other artists I like are John Mayer, Ed Sheeran, The Beatles, Queen, 
  Laufey, Nothing But Thieves, Blur, Scott Helman, Weezer, John Scofield, Julian Lage, Pat Metheny, and Wes Montgomery.</p>

  I have been guitar lessons since spring of 2019 with a local musician named Lucas Haneman. Give his band, the
  Lucas Haneman Express, a listen!
