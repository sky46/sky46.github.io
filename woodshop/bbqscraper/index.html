        The first project was a wooden barbecue scraper. Barbecue scrapers are used for cleaning out the grill on your barbecue.
        There are a few reasons for using a wooden scraper over a wire brush. The metal wires can break, possibly contaminating your
        food, or they may damage your barbecue. The hot grates burn down the edge of the scraper over time, giving it a sort of custom fit for your grill.
        There's also the environmental advantage of using wood instead of metal or nylon.
        <br><br>
        To create the scrapers, I first researched designs from the internet, used that to make my own design, and then created the scraper out of 
        cedar wood in the woodshop. Cedar was chosen mainly due to its ability to withstand rot (a barbecue scraper will probably
        be left outside or in a drawer/box for long periods of time).
