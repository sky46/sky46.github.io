      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        I'm a student in Grade 8. Science and math are my favourite subjects. I play the guitar and love
        listening to music. I also enjoy playing hockey, tennis and ultimate frisbee.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I am an avid learner; I've always enjoyed school. My favourite subjects are science and math. I'm very curious
        about how our world works. Understanding mysterious forces like gravity and light is very interesting to me.
        Recently, I applied for the IB (International Baccalaureate) programme at my local high school. IB is a secondary
        school diploma programme dedicated to providing a rich, rigorous education that encourages leadership,
        independence, and creativity. I really hope to get in, as I think it'll help me become a better learner and
        I'll be able to meet others who share my passion and interest for learning.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I love using technology. Playing video games and programming are some of my favourite hobbies. I started
        taking CS50x in late 2020, and it was a really great experience. I had a bit of prior experience from learning
        Python from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, but CS50 still taught me a lot. In the CS50 community, I've
        met many passionate, skilled programmers. I love programming because it's amazing seeing code that you wrote
        put into action. Technology is almost magical sometimes.
      </p>

      <h3>About The Skloud</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        I made this site for Homepage, a assignment in week 8 of CS50x. However, I spent way too much time trying to perfect tiny
        details like spacing and Bootstrap, so it took a lot longer than a week. With school starting and everything
        else, it ended up taking a couple months to complete it!
      </p>

      <p>
        "The Skloud" is a genius portmanteau of Skyler, my name, and the Cloud. Just kidding, it's a pretty terrible combination.
