        The second project was a wood joinery frame. It's a little frame made out of wood that demonstrates a few different joints commonly used in woodworking. 
        The frame itself doesn't really serve any practical purpose; it's more of a project where we learn and practice creating these joints, so we know how 
        they work, and how to create and use them in future projects. We also learned about the various advantages and disadvantages of each.
        <br><br>
        Unlike the BBQ scraper, where we all had our own designs, for this project everyone used the same design and dimensions. Again, this 
        was likely because it was only a learning/practicing project rather than an actual product--furthermore, 
        many of us wouldnâ€™t have even known how exactly to create these joints. It was definitely a step up from 
        simply picking a shape for our BBQ scrapers.
